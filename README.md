ok, here is an example: https://github.com/kivy-school/kivymacmultiprocess

it works in mac through `python main.py`

there is also a python specfile, run it with `python -m PyInstaller HelloMulti.spec --clean`

and in the dist folder there is sample apps (although the .app failed to push correctly)
